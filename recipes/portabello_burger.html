        <h2>Vegan Burger Bliss</h2>
        
        <p>Who hasn't been in the mood for a healthy, nutritios meal? I know I haven't.
            I wouldn't cook this vegan food voluntarily, but since my daughters boyfriend refuses to even look at cutting board that
            has been used to cut meat on, I haven't had any choice. Burgers does at least have a bit of inherent masculinity, so that
            makes things a bit easier for me. I'm very lucky that I can write these recipes anonymously, because I would lose the respect
            of my co-workers at the Volvo factory if they knew I made a meal where at least something hasn't died. 
        </p>

        <p>Anyways, take a big swig of strong whisky or smoke a cigar. You need to up your manlihood by a few points, 
            because this meal will debuff those stats. I usually start my spotify <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6PwFJJK9vwetlMzqKd6RL5?si=7750290b655b4ed7">playlist</a>
            with a lot of guy music, crank up the volume so I can drown out the Hyperpop from my daughters room.
            Having this playlist going I can blame my tears on the hardcore riffs and awesome lyrics,
            instead of the fact that I'm cooking <em>mushrooms</em>.

                <li>Try to convince your daughter that your ex-wife does, in fact, <em>not</em> have to come pick her up, and that you do in fact act as any adult and mature father would.</li>
