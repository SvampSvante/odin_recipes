        <h2>A rich and creamy soup that will
             warm your stomach and heart</h2>
        Wake up from your nightmares and taste this <em>awesome</em> soup. It
        rocked my world harder than when I saw Mot√∂rhead playing
        live at Ullevi 2007. Be a true man, stop scouring the internet 
        and start cooking!
        <p>Anyways, this soup <strong>must</strong> contain mushroom 
            that you've foraged yourself. Otherwise your not allowed to make
            this soup. It also contains cream, garlic and a bit of parsley, which you
            are allowed to buy at the store.</p>
