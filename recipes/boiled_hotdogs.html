        <h2>Simple food that carries the complex flavors</h2>

            <em>"Fine Dining"</em>. I personally have only heard that term from academics, rich people and the media. 
            No one I trust have been to a Fine Dining. How do I know that it acutally exists? Where's the evidence?
            I'm not saying that it's a conspiracy, but the goverment sure does seem to make it so that no ordinary man visits
            these "Fine Diners". I've driven past a few during my nigthly rides in my Volvo. Everyone is empty.
            A bit strange, right?

            <p>
            Anyways, the working class at the bottom of the pyramid (a.k.a. <em>all of us</em>) still have good food to
            eat. Like, who doesn't love the a good, steaming hot dog straight from the kettle above a huge bonfire? 
            Yeah, sure it's not a <em>complex Sóúp dè Flúffë</em> or whatever the upper class claims that they eat.
            But boiled meat, bread, ketchup, mustard and bit of roasted onions? Oof, if that doesn't pack a taste punch,
            I don't want to eat ever again.
