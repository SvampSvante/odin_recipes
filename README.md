My first try at building a website.

This project is for testing my abilities to create a basic website from scratch.
I will be using Git to track my progress. The website will contain headings, lists
(ordered and unordered), links, images and a few more elements.

This project will help me devolop my project-building and problem-solving skills,
since I'm a beginner programmer doing this on my own. It will make me more comfortable
with creating the HTML backbone for a website.
